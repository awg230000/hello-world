  <h1>About Me!</h1>
  <body>
    <p>My name is Adam Gamil and I have always been extremely interested in the many different opportunities in various creative fields. I find critical web design to be extremely important though because it shapes the way humans interact and share information. Personally, I am very interested in media like videography and photgraphy. I have been in the media field for a few years now, and I can now comfortably say that it is a creative field that I would love to be able to pursue as a career. My personal favorite type of critical web design is any sort of design that deals with the videography aspect of a website. Websites that include interesting visuals and interactive videos are what I find to be the most interesting and engaging. Here are some examples:</p> <br>
